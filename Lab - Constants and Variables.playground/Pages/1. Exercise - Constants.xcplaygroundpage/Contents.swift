/*:
## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */

let friends = 755
//:  Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Attempt to update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is. Observe what happens and then move to the next step.
// 會無法運行
//let friends = 650
//:  Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friends` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
print("上述「更新過後的朋友」程式碼無法運行，是因為使用的是let做常數的宣告，因此只要friends被賦予值之後就無法再依序做更改")
