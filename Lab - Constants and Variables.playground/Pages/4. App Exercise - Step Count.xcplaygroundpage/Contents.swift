## App Exercise - Step Count
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
Create a variable called `steps` that will keep track of the number of steps you take throughout the day. Set its initial value to 0 to represent the step count first thing in the morning. Print `steps` to the console.
 */
// 建立一個名為「steps」的變數 ， 初始值為0
var steps = 0

// 將 steps 印出
print(steps)
//:  Now assume the tracker has been keeping track of steps all morning, and you want to show the user the latest step count. Update `steps` to be 2000. Print `steps` to the console. Then print "Good job! You're well on your way to your daily goal."
steps = 2000

print(steps)
print("Good job! You're well on your way to your daily goal.")
print("Now your steps to be \(steps).")
