## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
// 宣告一個 schooling 的變數，給予一個值8 ，目前 8 年級
var schooling = 8
//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
// 剛完成了一年的學業
schooling = 9

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("可以正常運作，與常數不同，變數是可以更新的，在這個例子中，將schooling設為變數，因此值可以更新")
